# Python 2D Physics Engine #

This project is a simple 2D Physics Engine made with Python and Pygame.

It may be expanded to a game later on, but for now the engine itself is still under development.

It is built off of "bodies" or things in the engine that can be contacted.

Static Bodies do not move - They are used for building the world around the objects that do move.
 
Kinematic Bodies are able to move - They have velocities, accelerations, friction, gravity, mass, and momentum transfer.

Kinematic Bodies may interact with static bodies, but static bodies may not interact with other static bodies.
